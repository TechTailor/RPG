This package is a simple Laravel untility that allows you to generate complex passwords using a simple Facade.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Through Composer

```bash
$ composer require techtailor/rpg
```

### Step 2: Add the Service Provider (Skip this step for Laravel 5.5 or higher)

In the 'config/app.php' file -

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    TechTailor\RPG\RPGServiceProvider::class,
];
```

### Step 3: Add the Alias (Skip this step for Laravel 5.5 or higher)

In the 'config/app.php' file -

```php
'aliases' => [
    // ...
    'RPG' => TechTailor\RPG\Facade\RPG::class,
];
```
In Laravel 5.5 & higher the package will autoregister the service provider and the alias.

## Usage

In order to use the included RPG Facade, import the following in your file

```php
use TechTailor\RPG\Facade\RPG;
```

### The RPG Facade comes with two basic methods - ``Generate`` and ``Preset``

The ``Generate`` method allows you to pass custom specifications for the generator. 

```php
 RPG::Generate($character, $size, $dashes, $encrypt);
```
Lets go into a bit detail about each of the specifications that can be provided

```bash
$character 
//Accepts a string of letters called "luds"
//Where > l is for lowercase alphabets
        > u is for uppercase alphabets
        > d is for digits
        > s is for special characters'
//The combination of these letters will provide the character set for the generator. Ex: 'ld' will only generate string with lowercase alphabets and digits.
```
```bash
$size
//The total size/lenght of the string your want to generate. 
//Ex : 15 - will generate a string of total 15 characters using the character set your selected
```
```bash
$dashes (defaults to 0)
//Two options - 0 or 1
//Using '1' - will add multiple dashes (-) randomly within the string generated.
```
```bash
$encrypt (defaults to 0)
//Two options - 0 or 1
//Using '1' - will return you an encrypted version of the password. Can be decrypted using RPG::Decrypt.
```
Example command for generating a password string of 16 characters with dashes using the 'lud (lowercase, uppercase, digits)' character set -
```bash
return RPG::Generate('lud',16,1); //Result: 37vX-zerT-weSa-vCC3
```
Example command for generating an encrypted password string of 16 characters with dashes using the 'lud (lowercase, uppercase, digits)' character set -
```bash
return RPG::Generate('lud',16,1,1); 

//Result: eyJpdiI6IjdTK3ZmMGZXNXl2a2xQSU1sNVhKZEE9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoiK1NxcTdUbVF3Q2dqSGVcL0JFKzRHR3VWNm5NWUdUNDY0dEFnOFN0S2JDdVk9IiwibWFjIjoiODEwMjIwOTBiNjBiOWRhMjJlNTliNGY0NzEyNDFjNmJkODIwZmFhMjMyY2IzOThkMzRmMTcyZGZkMjk1ZmUwYiJ9
```

The ``Preset`` method allows you to instantly select from any of the 4 preset specifications for the generator. You can also ad the encrypt modifier to the Preset method aswell for returning an encrypted Preset String.

```php
 RPG::Preset($preset); //Where $preset value can be 1, 2, 3 or 4.
 or
 RPG::Preset($preset,1); // For encrypting the result before returning it.
```
Details of each preset -
```bash
 Preset - 1
 //Character Set = 'ld' //Size = 8  //Dashes = 0 (Dashes Not allowed)
 //Sample Result: cn3hvphy
 Preset - 2
 //Character Set = 'lud' //Size = 8  //Dashes = 0 (Dashes Not allowed)
 //Sample Result: 4sCFwNr8
 Preset - 3
 //Character Set = 'luds' //Size = 12  //Dashes = 0 (Dashes Not allowed)
 //Sample Result: r&$EQx1#USbw
 Preset - 4
 //Character Set = 'luds' //Size = 16  //Dashes = 1 (Dashes Allowed)
 //Sample Result: 1Z2h-F&?C-x$Tg-KEA8
 Preset - 5
 //Character Set = 'luds' //Size = 32  //Dashes = 1 (Dashes Allowed)
 //Sample Result: 1Z2h-F&?C-x$Tg-KEA8-a2E3-E$#e-@#we-12@2
```
### Important Note
The passwords are encrypted using the Laravel App Key (which can be found in your .env file). If you change/modify your Laravel App Key, you will no longer be able to decrypt any previously encrypted strings.

Well that should be enough to get you up and running in no time.
